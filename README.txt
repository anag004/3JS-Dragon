Hotkeys:

1. "L": The dragon performs the first dance sequence which is a loop de loop. 
The angle of the neck, legs and tail change during different parts of the loop.

2. "R": The dragon performs a roll, the neck points upwards during the first half 
of the roll and then points downwards during the second half when the dragon brakes.

3. "W" / "S": The dragon speeds up / slows down respectively. The neck, tail and legs 
change angle to provide streamlining.

4. "A" / "D": The dragon rolls to either side 

5. "H" / "J": Control the pitch of the dragon. When the dragon is going downwards the 
neck is perpendicular to the body for braking. When going up, it is parallel to the body.

Comments:

The wings were self-modeled in Blender (.blend file included), using a reference image 
from the web (also included).

The neck and tail are jointed (each with 10 links each) to provide a smooth and organic 
neck and tail animation
